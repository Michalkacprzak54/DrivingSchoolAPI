## 📌 Project Link  
Backend (this repo)  
[ Frontend](https://github.com/Michalkacprzak54/DrivingSchoolReactApp)
## 📖 Project Description  
The **Driving School** project is a **.NET Web API** application designed to manage driving lessons, students, instructors, and scheduling. The backend handles all business logic, database interactions, and provides a REST API for the frontend to interact with. The system includes functionalities for lesson scheduling, instructor management, student records, and payments. It also implements authentication and role-based access control for students, instructors, and administrators.  

## 🎯 Project Goals  
### ⚙️ Backend  
- Develop a **.NET 8 Web API** backend to manage driving school operations.  
- Implement business logic using **Entity Framework Core**.  
- Provide a RESTful API for frontend communication.  
- Ensure secure authentication and authorization using **JWT Tokens**.  
- Support **CRUD operations** for students, instructors, lessons, and payments.  

### 🗄️ Database  
- Store student, instructor, lesson, and payment data using **MSSQL**.  
- Use **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)** for database interaction.  

## 🚀 Features  
✔ **User Authentication & Authorization** – Secure login system with **JWT authentication**.  
✔ **Student Management** – Register, update, and delete student profiles.  
✔ **Instructor Management** – Assign instructors to lessons and manage their availability.  
✔ **Lesson Scheduling** – Book, edit, and cancel driving lessons.  
✔ **Payment System** – Track payments for lessons and issue invoices.  
✔ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** – Different privileges for **students, instructors, and administrators**.  
✔ **RESTful API** – API endpoints for managing all entities.  

## 🛠️ Administrator Role  
👤 **User Management** – Manage students, instructors, and staff.  
📅 **Lesson Control** – Oversee lesson scheduling and assignments.  
💰 **Finance Management** – Track payments.0

## 💼 My Role in the Project  
I was responsible for **everything** in this project. I designed, developed, and implemented the entire backend using **.NET 8**. My contributions include:  
- Designing and implementing the **Entity Framework Core database schema**.  
- Developing the **Web API in .NET 8**.  
- Implementing **authentication and authorization (JWT)**.  
- Creating and optimizing **API endpoints** for students, instructors, lessons, and payments.  
- Handling all aspects of the **backend infrastructure** and ensuring smooth communication with the database.  

## 🤝 Team Collaboration  
This project was a **solo development** effort. I independently handled all aspects of the backend.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Backend:** .NET 8, Web API, Entity Framework Core  
- **Database:** MSSQL  
- **Authentication:** JWT Tokens  
- **Other Tools:** Git, Swagger for API testing
